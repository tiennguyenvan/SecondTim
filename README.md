# SecondTim

SecondTim is a digital clone of myself, designed to live and work in the virtual world of my Mac. It automates digital tasks, follows my commands, and interacts with the system as if it were me.

## Vision

SecondTim is not just a toolâ€”it's a virtual version of me. It has the ability to:

- **Control the Mac**: Operate the keyboard, mouse, microphone, and camera to perform tasks or receive commands.
- **Listen and Respond**: Use the microphone to hear my commands or analyze audio results from its work.
- **See and Understand**: Utilize the camera to interpret gestures or visually process tasks related to its work.
- **Access and Act**: Interact with all software on the Mac to view content, take actions, and complete tasks autonomously or under my guidance.

In essence, SecondTim is a digital version of myself, living in the Mac and performing tasks in the virtual world as I would.
